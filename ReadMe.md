## What is this?
This is side project for mostly fun, I wanted to use the [__d3-network graphs__](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/network.html) __in a .net / C# environment__ and so I decided to try and rewrite [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) using C# (this is the main library used to create network graphs in d3.) I thought it might be fun and I could learn a thing or two!

This may turn out to be more of a daunting and complex task than I expected but there is only one way of finding out :)


## About D3
You can read more about __D3__ [here](https://d3js.org/) but basically its an opensource javascript library that can be used to _display & manipulate data in all types of interactive diagrams/graphs/illustrations_ and so on ...

The library seems to be pretty flexible and low level and so one could use a wrapper library like [observable plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/).
